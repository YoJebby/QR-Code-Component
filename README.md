## My process

### Built with

- HTML5

- Flexbox

### What I learned

 Learned the correct way to center content using flexbox thanks to @Hassiai.

  ```css
  body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
  }
  ```
  Learned which units are important to use and the difference between px and rem units.
